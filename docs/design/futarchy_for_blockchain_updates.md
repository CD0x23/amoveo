Futarchy for Blockchain Updates
=========

I have noticed some inefficiencies in how the network agrees upon updates.

1) if the developer is too popular, then their time becomes saturated from lobbyists trying to convince the developer to make upgrades that will make the lobbyist rich. Too much time with lobbyists makes it harder for the developer to know what upgrades are important.

2) the developer of an update is vulnerable to bribery and corruption from lobbyists.

3) if the developer is not popular enough, then they are unable to convince the network to consider their upgrades.

Futarchy can solve these problem at once.
Developers should program everything the community could be interested in, and futarchy should be used to decide which updates to merge into the mainnet.

To test this out, I have made an oracle with this question:
"X = retarget branch gets merged into mainnet before block height 29000; Y = price of veo around height 30000 is > $300; (X AND Y) OR (!X AND !Y)."
Here is the oracle's ID: OaQb/xyYNbqrT4p/P8i7wfvo7zWo7GkCUBFfI8RuRNE=

you can participate in this market here: http://139.59.144.76:8080/explorer.html

If the price of True is higher than the price of False, then that means merging the retarget branch update would increase the odds of Amoveo being worth more than $300.

This way you can't use lobbying to give an advantage to the update you prefer.
And it doesn't matter which developers are popular, everyone has equal opportunity to make updates.
And the best updates have a way to stand out and get accepted.

The idea of using futarchy for blockchain updates comes from Paul Sztorc http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/win-win-blocksize/
