    {prune_period, 10}, %% this is how frequently we prune all the data from the trees from before revert_depth.
    %% if prune period is low, then you will use less ram, but you will waste more cpu on pruning.
    {revert_depth, 20}, %% save all data from the most recent block, and this far into history. That way if blocks are reverted, we still have all the state. For light nodes this should be set to 0.
    %% if a fork is bigger than revert_depth, your full node will have to reprocess all the blocks, or it will have to download a bunch of proofs.

    {light_node, false},
    {trie_size, 20000}, %%  we can adjust this many accounts and channels in all the blocks in revert_depth. So it is important that the number of proofs per block * revert_depth is smaller than this number. Max block size starts around 207560.
    %% There are several trees, they are all stored in ram. It is important that trie_size*sum(size of an element in each trie) < (amount of ram you have).

    {minimum_tx_fee, 9}, %% Only txs with this fee or higher get accepted into your mempool. If you are a miner, you are censoring all txs with lower fees.

    {fork_tolerance, 20}, %% This is used by the channel manager. If the channel has been closed this many blocks, then the channel managers garbage collection would delete it.
                     %% it is also used when syncing. You download this many extra headers to check if you are on a fork.
    {headers_batch, 101}, %% You download up to this many headers per request.

    %% there are around 8000 blocks a month. This node is designed to double its balance at least every 10 months, if it is working at full capacity. It is expected to double its money every 5 months.

    {min_channel_ratio, 0.5}, %% So the customer needs to put in twice as much money as the server.

    {bet_gas_limit, 100000},%% these limits are for when you are making channels off-chain. you are avoiding making a channel that would be excessively expensive to close on-chain.
