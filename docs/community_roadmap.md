that is less precise than my todo list, and more exciting for the community to look at.


* VEO-BTC exchange
  - This will allow people to more easily buy and sell Veo.
  - This will make it easy for people who aren't currently invested in Veo to participate in Amoveo markets.

* combinatorial markets
  - you can read about it on page 4 of this PDF from BitcoinHivemind: http://bitcoinhivemind.com/papers/2_PM_Types.pdf
  - This type of market uses 2 oracles instead of 1, and it has 9 possible outcomes instead of 3.

* acquire first users of the markets. Try these things to search for potential users:
  - use a smart contract to pay a reward to someone for uploading a torrent for an expensive textbook.
  - use a market to fund the creation of something for Amoveo.
  - use a combinatorial market to decide how we will do something for Amoveo.
  - use a markets to do things from this list: http://bitcoinhivemind.com/papers/3_PM_Applications.pdf 

* study our users, and keep improving Amoveo based on how they use it and what they want.

* rename and rebrand Amoveo based on who our first users are, and who it makes sense to market ourselves towards.

* use a smart contract to incentivize targetted advertising to grow our user base.
