Using the oracle, the parameters that define the system can be modified. The mechanism is built with the goal that the oracle will choose parameters that make the value of Veo increase.

We have an oracle that asks "should this variable be pushed up or down?".

Depending on the final state of the oracle, the variable is changed.


The parameters that can be modified are:
* block reward - how much reward the miner gets for finding a block.
* developer_reward - developers get this reward when a block is mined.
* fun_limit - how many functions can a smart contract use.
* time_gas - this is a limit on how many CPU cycles a smart contract can use.
* space_limit - how much ram can a smart contract use.
* oracle_initial_liquidity - how much does it cost to launch an oracle.
* maximum_question_size - how many bytes big can a question for the oracle be
* governance_change_limit - this is a limit on how quickly you can modify the governance variables.
* fees for each of the different transaction types.
