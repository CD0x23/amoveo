    <h1>Finance Game</h1>
    <p>instructions: This game has rounds. In each round you can invest as much money in your business as you want, and you can buy as much insurance for your business as you want. The business has a 40% chance of failure because your government periodically blocks exports. If exports are blocked, then you lose everything you invested, but your insurance pays you %240 as much as the cost of the insurance you purchased. If exports are allowed, then the money you invested doubles, but the insurance pays you nothing. The goal is to have a strategy that consistently scores at least 1500. </p>
