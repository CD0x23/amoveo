Financial derivatives are a big part of the economy, and they will continue getting bigger.
=====
- hedging against risk.
  - as economy grows, so do risks that we want to hedge.
- selling information.
  - as science improves, there are more and more opportunities to learn valuable facts.

for financial derivatives, blockchain > centralized institution.
=====
- Financial derivatives today are expensive because of trusted third parties fees and the cost of regulatory compliance.
  - blockchains enable financial derivatives without having to trust a third party. So we don't have to pay a fee to any trusted third party.
  - blockchains enable us to circumvent regulatory compliance costs.
