#### Mining

[There is better mining software available here](https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo-c-miner)

The mining software integrated into the full node is useful for testing, and as a reference implementation. The full node is not a cost effective miner.


After fresh install, one can start mining.

To start mining with all CPU cores: 
```
mine:start().
```
To stop mining:
```
mine:stop().
```
to check if you are currently mining:
```
mine:status().
```
