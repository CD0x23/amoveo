This is a roadmap that is less precise than my todo list, and more exciting for the community to look at.

1) Get the exchange working.
2) Find people who want to use our prediction market.
3) Watch how they use the prediction market, keep updating to serve them better.
4) Rebrand from Amoveo to a name that relates to our first popular use-case.
